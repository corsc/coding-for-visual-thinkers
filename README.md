# Coding for Visual Thinkers

Not everybody sees the world the same way; by extension not everybody learns the same way.

This collection of episodes hopes to explain programming concepts; that are inherently abstract in a manner that makes 
sense to folks that see learn concepts visually. 

It is my opinion that when learning programming it's far more important to understand these underlying concepts than 
language syntax.  These concepts will appear in most, if not all languages.

Think of it like driving a car.  Once you learn to drive in one car, you can drive many other types of cars and even 
driving similar vehicles (i.e. trucks) follow also identical concepts.
